# Date Time Calculator

This code is a simple tool for calculating the time difference between the current time and a target date and continuously displaying the elapsed time until the target date is reached. 

The user is prompted to enter the target date and time in a specific format, and the code then calculates the time difference and updates the display every second. The terminal screen is also cleared after every update for a cleaner display.

To use this code, ensure that Python is installed on your operating system. If it is not already installed, you can download it from https://python.org. 

Once Python is installed, navigate to the directory where the code is stored and run the following command in your command prompt or terminal: 

```
python3 date_calculator.py
```
or
```
python date_calculator.py
```

You will be prompted to enter the target date and time in the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS". Once entered, the code will begin calculating and displaying the elapsed time until the target date is reached.

Overall, this code is a useful tool for anyone who needs to track time between dates, and it can be easily customized or integrated into other projects as needed.
